## Topic

Streaming platforms have reshaped how songs gain popularity and longevity. In the past, major record labels were a necessity for success. Nowadays, even small creators can achieve success due to recommendation algorithms and social media trends. Beyond streaming, social media platforms like TikTok have become powerful drivers of music discovery. Viral trends and challenges can propel a song to mainstream success, sometimes even before it gains traction on traditional streaming services. In 2024, 13 out of the 16 songs that reached No.1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 were linked to TikTok trends ([Music Business Worldwide](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/tiktok-reveals-its-top-songs-of-2024-says-that-13-of-16-no-1-hits-in-the-us-this-year-are-linked-to-trends-on-its-platform/)).

Since the rise of digital streaming, playlist inclusion on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music has become a critical factor in determining a song’s success. A song that gets added to a playlist is both appealing on first listen and after repeated listens. Therfore a song's inclusion in playlists signifies its long-term listening appeal. 

The primary focus of this project is to predict the probability of a song being added to a playlist, using a dataset enriched with streaming statistics, social media engagement, and metadata from APIs like Spotify and MusicBrainz.

Additional subtopics to be explored include:

- Determining to what extent social media influences track popularity
- Identifying characteristics of songs that contribute to long-term success and replayability
- Investigating the interaction between streaming platform algorithms and organic listener engagement
- And more!

### Why?

A song’s ability to sustain engagement over time is crucial in today’s music industry. Playlist-worthy songs not only attract immediate attention but also maintain their appeal over multiple listens. Understanding what makes a song "playlist material" can help artists, record labels, and streaming platforms optimize their strategies for song promotion, curation, and discovery.

### Who is affected?

- **Artists and Producers:** Understanding what makes a song playlist-worthy can guide creative and promotion decisions
- **Record Labels:** Predicting playlist inclusion can help with marketing strategies
- **Streaming Platforms:** Improving recommendation algorithms based on playlist behavior can increase listening time
- **Listeners:** Playlists with good songs enhance the user experience

### Related work

Several studies and industry reports have explored factors influencing song popularity, such as the impact of streaming algorithms, social media trends, and audio features. 

**Hit Song Prediction:** Machine learning has been applied to predict a song’s success based on audio features, lyrics, and listener engagement. A study in *Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence* found that neural data significantly improves hit song classification accuracy ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2023.1154663/full)).

**Social Media Influence:** Platforms like TikTok and YouTube have reshaped music discovery, often determining which songs become hits. Research from Neuroscience News found that social networks can increase music popularity prediction accuracy by 50% ([Neuroscience News](https://neurosciencenews.com/social-connections-music-26294/)).

This project builds upon these studies by integrating streaming statistics, social media engagement metrics, and metadata to predict a song's probability of being added to playlists, an important metric to determine the long-term engagement of a song.

## Research Questions

1. What audio and metadata features correlate with high playlist inclusion probability?
2. How do social media engagement metrics (e.g. TikTok posts, YouTube likes) influence playlist-worthiness?
3. Does playlist inclusion probability differ across genres and regions?
4. How do streaming performance metrics (e.g. Spotify popularity, YouTube views) relate to playlist inclusion?
5. Does song length affect playlist-worthiness?
6. Do newer songs have a higher probability of being included in playlists compared to older tracks?
7. What impact does a song’s initial viral success have on its long-term playlist performance?
8. What differences exist in playlist curation strategies across streaming platforms?
9. How accurately can machine learning models predict whether a song will be added to a playlist?
10. What characteristics distinguish user-generated playlists from editorially curated ones?
